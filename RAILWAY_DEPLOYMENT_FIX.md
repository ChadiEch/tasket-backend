# Railway Deployment Fix for File Uploads

This document explains how to fix the issue where uploaded files are not accessible after redeploying the backend server.

## Problem

After redeploying the backend server, uploaded attachments are not accessible with errors like:
```
Cannot GET /uploads/task-attachment-1759996198301-482904203.png
```

## Root Cause

The issue occurs because Railway's default deployment process does not preserve the local file system between deployments. When you redeploy, the container is recreated and any files stored in the container's local filesystem are lost.

## Solution

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that uploaded files are stored in a persistent location that survives redeployments.

### Option 1: Use Railway Volumes (Recommended)

Railway provides a volumes feature that allows you to persist data between deployments. Update your Railway configuration to use volumes:

1. In your Railway project dashboard:
   - Go to the "Volumes" tab
   - Create a new volume mapped to `/app/persistent_uploads`

2. Update your [railway.docker-compose.yml](file:///c%3A/Users/user/Downloads/uploads%20%282%29/railway.docker-compose.yml) file:
   ```yaml
   services:
     backend:
       # ... other configuration
       volumes:
         - railway_volume:/app/persistent_uploads
   
   volumes:
     railway_volume:
       driver: local
   ```

### Option 2: Use External Storage Service

For production deployments, consider using an external storage service like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Railway's built-in storage.

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install aws-sdk
   ```

2. Update the upload middleware to store files in external storage:
   ```javascript
   // In middleware/upload.js
   const uploadToStorage = async (file) => {
     // Implementation for uploading to external storage
     // Return the URL to access the file
   };
   ```

### Option 3: Manual Backup and Restore

As a temporary workaround, you can manually backup and restore uploaded files:

1. Before redeploying, backup the uploads directory:
   ```bash
   tar -czf uploads_backup.tar.gz tasket-backend/persistent_uploads
   ```

2. After redeploying, restore the uploads directory:
   ```bash
   tar -xzf uploads_backup.tar.gz -C tasket-backend/
   ```

## Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are set in your Railway project:

```
UPLOADS_DIR=/app/persistent_uploads
```

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Upload a file through the application
2. Redeploy the application
3. Verify the file is still accessible at `/uploads/filename.ext`

## Best Practices

1. Always use persistent storage for uploaded files in production
2. Implement proper error handling for file operations
3. Regularly backup important uploaded files
4. Monitor storage usage to prevent running out of space
5. Consider implementing file cleanup policies for old files
